## Machine Learning as a Service for HEP

MLaaS for HEP is a set of Python-based modules to support reading HEP data and
stream them to the ML tool of the user's choice. It consists of three independent layers:
- Data Streaming layer to handle remote data, see [reader.py](https://github.com/vkuznet/MLaaS4HEP/blob/master/src/python/MLaaS4HEP/reader.py)
- Data Training layer to train ML model for given HEP data, see [workflow.py](https://github.com/vkuznet/MLaaS4HEP/blob/master/src/python/MLaaS4HEP/workflow.py)
- Data Inference layer, see [tfaas_client.py](https://github.com/vkuznet/TFaaS/blob/master/src/python/tfaas_client.py)

The MLaaS4HEP resopitory can be found [here](https://github.com/vkuznet/MLaaS4HEP).

The general architecture of MLaaS4HEP looks like this:
![MLaaS4HEP-architecture](https://github.com/vkuznet/MLaaS4HEP/blob/master/images/MLaaS4HEP_arch_root_white_bkg.png)

Even though this architecture was originally developed for dealing with
HEP ROOT files, we extend it to other data formats. As of right now, following
data formats are supported: JSON, CSV, Parquet, and ROOT. All of the formats 
support reading files from the local file system or HDFS, while the 
ROOT format supports reading files via the [XRootD](https://xrootd.slac.stanford.edu) protocol.

The pre-trained models can be easily uploaded to
[TFaaS](https://github.com/vkuznet/TFaaS) inference server for serving them to clients.
The TFaaS documentation can be found [here](https://github.com/cms-ml/documentation/blob/master/content/inference/tfaas.md).

### Dependencies
Here is a list of the dependencies:
- [pyarrow](https://arrow.apache.org) for reading data from HDFS file system
- [uproot](https://github.com/scikit-hep/uproot) for reading ROOT files
- [numpy](https://www.numpy.org), [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org) for data representation
- [modin](https://github.com/modin-project/modin) for fast panda support

### Installation
The easiest way to install and run [MLaaS4HEP](https://cloud.docker.com/u/veknet/repository/docker/veknet/mlaas4hep) and [TFaaS](https://cloud.docker.com/u/veknet/repository/docker/veknet/tfaas) is to use pre-build docker images
```
# run MLaaS4HEP docker container
docker run veknet/mlaas4hep
# run TFaaS docker container
docker run veknet/tfaas
```

### Reading ROOT files
MLaaS4HEP python repository provides the `reader.py` module that defines a DataReader class able to read either local or remote ROOT files (via xrootd) in chunks. It is based on the
[uproot](https://github.com/scikit-hep/uproot) framework.

Basic usage
```
# setup the proper environment, e.g. 
# export PYTHONPATH=/path/src/python # path to MLaaS4HEP python framework
# export PATH=/path/bin:$PATH # path to MLaaS4HEP binaries

# get help and option description
reader --help

# here is a concrete example of reading local ROOT file:
reader --fin=/opt/cms/data/Tau_Run2017F-31Mar2018-v1_NANOAOD.root --info --verbose=1 --nevts=2000

# here is an example of reading remote ROOT file:
reader --fin=root://cms-xrd-global.cern.ch//store/data/Run2017F/Tau/NANOAOD/31Mar2018-v1/20000/6C6F7EAE-7880-E811-82C1-008CFA165F28.root --verbose=1 --nevts=2000 --info

# both of aforementioned commands produce the following output

### How to train ML models on HEP ROOT data
The MLaaS4HEP framework allows to train ML models in different ways:
- using full dataset (i.e. the entire amount of events stored in input ROOT files)
- using chunks, as subsets of a dataset, which dimension can be chosen directly by the user and can vary between 1 and the total number of events
- using local or remote ROOT files.

The training phase is managed by the `workflow.py` module which performs the following actions:
- read all input ROOT files in chunks to compute a specs file (where the main information about the ROOT files are stored: the dimension of branches, the minimum and the maximum for each branch, and the number of events for each ROOT file)
- perform the training cycle (each time using a new chunk of events)
  - create a new chunk of events taken proportionally from the input ROOT files
    - extract and convert each event in a list of NumPy arrays
    - normalize the events
    - fix the Jagged Arrays dimension
    - create the masking vector
  - use the chunk to train the ML model provided by the user

A schematic representation of the steps performed in the MLaaS4HEP pipeline, in particular those inside the Data Streaming and Data Training layers, is:

:warning:
If the dataset is large and exceed the amount of RAM on the training node, then the user should consider the chunk approach. This allows to train the ML model each time using a different chunk, until the entire dataset is completely read. In this case the user should pay close attention to the ML model convergence, and validate it after each chunk. For more information look at [this](https://developers.google.com/machine-learning/glossary#convergence), [this](https://machinelearningmastery.com/premature-convergence/) and [this](https://machinelearningmastery.com/learning-curves-for-diagnosing-machine-learning-model-performance/). Using different training approach has pros and cons. For instance, training on entire dataset can guarantee the ML model convergence, but the dataset should fits into RAM of the training node. While chunk approach allows to split the dataset to fit in the hardware resources, but it requires proper model evaluation after each chunk training. In terms of training speed, this choice should be faster than training on the entire dataset, since after having used a chunk for training, that chunk is no longer read and used subsequently (this effect is prominent when remote ROOT files are used). Finally, user should be aware of potential divergence of ML model when training last chunk of the dataset and check for bias towards last chunk. For instance, user may implement a K-fold cross validation approach to train on N-1 chunks (i.e. folds in this case) and use one chunk for validation.

A detailed description of how to use the `workflow.py` module for training a ML model reading ROOT files from the opendata portal, can be found [here](https://github.com/vkuznet/MLaaS4HEP/blob/master/doc/workflow_recipe.md). Please see how the user has to provide several information when run the `workflow.py` module, e.g. the definition of the ML model, and then is task of MLaaS4HEP framework to perform all the training procedure using the ML model provided by the user.
