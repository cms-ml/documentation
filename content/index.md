Welcome to the documentation hub for the CMS Machine Learning Group! The goal of this page is to provide CMS analyzers a centralized place to gather machine learning information relevant to their work. However, we are not seeking to rewrite external documentation. Whenever applicable, we will link to external documentation, such as the iML groups [HEP Living Review](https://iml-wg.github.io/HEPML-LivingReview/) or their [ML Resources](https://github.com/iml-wg/HEP-ML-Resources) repository. What you will find here are pages covering:

  - ML best practices
  - How to optimize a NN
  - Common pitfalls for CMS analyzers
  - Direct and indirect inferencing using a variety of ML packages
  - How to get a model integrated into CMSSW

And much more!

We recently launched v1 of the ML Knowledge Newsletter located [here](https://cernbox.cern.ch/s/eo9pBAV7W1AMMpK), and we're also looking for new writers and contributors. If you would like to be featured in this newsletter or would like to nominate someone to be featured, please let us know!
