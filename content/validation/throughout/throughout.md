* general notes on hyperparameter choice
    - briefly ways to optimise (random search, grid-search, evolutionary, reference bayesian optimisation section)
* under/overfitting
    - model regularisation
    - monitoring performance on validation data set/early stopping/cross-validation
    - overfitting to a validation data set (if validating the model on it too many times)
* ways to optimise (reference existing or mention not yet covered): LR schedulers / train&test augmentations / snapshot ensembles
