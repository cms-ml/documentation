[hls4ml](https://fastmachinelearning.org/hls4ml/) is a Python package developed by the [Fast Machine Learning Lab](https://fastmachinelearning.org/). It's primary purpose is to create firmware implementations of machine learning (ML) models to be run on FPGAs. The package interfaces with a high-level synthesis (HLS) backend (i.e. Xilinx Vivado HLS) to transpile the ML model into hardware description language (HDL). The primary hls4ml documentation, including API reference pages, is located [here](https://fastmachinelearning.org/hls4ml/).

The main hls4ml tutorial code is kept on [GitHub](https://github.com/fastmachinelearning/hls4ml-tutorial). Users are welcome to walk through the notebooks at their own pace. There is also a set of slides linked to the [README](https://github.com/fastmachinelearning/hls4ml-tutorial/blob/master/README.md).

That said, there have been several cases where the hls4ml developers have given live demonstrations and tutorials. Below is a non-exhaustive list of tutorials given in the last few years (newest on top).
