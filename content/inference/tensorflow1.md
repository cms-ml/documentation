# Direct inference with TensorFlow 1

While it is technically still possible to use TensorFlow 1, this version of TensorFlow is quite old and is no longer supported by CMSSW. We highly recommend that you update your model to TensorFlow 2 and follow the integration guide in the [Inference/Direct inference/TensorFlow 2](tensorflow2.md) documentation.
